	<h1>The Morphogenetic Field: Introduction</h1>
	<p class = "p1">A <b>morphogenetic field</b> (a subset of <i>morphic field</i>) is a hypothetical biological (and potentially social) 
field that contains the information necessary to shape the exact <strong>form</strong> of a living thing, as part of its epigenetics, 
and may also shape its <strong>behaviour</strong> and coordination with other beings. <b><a href="google.com" target="_blank">Google</a></b></p>

	Lotus asks what Junpei and Santa think the picture is of. After Junpei gives his answer, Lotus states that it is 
a picture of a dog. She explains that an experiment in Great Britain had taken place that asked a group of 1000 people 
to identify two pictures. One picture was the dog picture, while the other is a picture of a woman wearing a hat. About 
9.2% of people figured out the lady picture, while only 3.9% identified the dog picture as a dog. Lotus goes on saying 
that after the experiment, another one was conducted where British TV could not reach. The experiment had only 850 people 
and had the subjects identify the same pictures. While the amount of people who identified the lady picture correctly only 
went up to 10%, the dog picture's results doubled. Lotus says that this increase could have only occurred because of
